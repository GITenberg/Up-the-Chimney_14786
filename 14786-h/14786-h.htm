<h2>
    Preface
</h2>
<p>
This play is intended, not only for acting, but also for reading.
It is so arranged that boys and girls can read it to themselves, just
as they would read any other story. Even the stage directions and the
descriptions of scenery are presented as a part of the narrative.
At the same time, by the use of different styles of type, the speeches
of the characters are clearly distinguished from the rest of the text,
an arrangement which will be found convenient when parts are being
memorized for acting.
</p>
<p>
The play has been acted more than once, and by different groups of
people; sometimes on a stage equipped with footlights, curtain, and
scenery; sometimes with barely any of these aids. Practical suggestions
as to costumes, scenery, and some simple scenic effects will be found
at the end of the play.
</p>
<p>
What sort of a Christmas play do the boys and girls like, and in what
sort do we like to see them take part? It should be a play, surely, in
which the dialogue is simple and natural, not stilted and artificial;
one that seems like a bit of real life, and yet has plenty of fancy and
imagination in it; one that suggests and helps to perpetuate some of
the happy and wholesome customs of Christmas; above all, one that is
pervaded by the Christmas spirit. I hope that this play does not
entirely fail to meet these requirements.

<h2>
    The Introduction
</h2>
<p>
<i>Before the curtain opens</i>, MOTHER GOOSE <i>comes out, and this is
what she says</i>:
</p>
<p>
Good evening, dear children. I see you are all expecting me to show you
a Christmas Play. Well, I have one ready, sure enough. And now let me
see, what shall I tell you about it? For one thing it will take place on
Christmas Eve, and then it will be all about Christmas, of course. The
first scene will be in the house, where a little girl and a little boy
live, with their father, who is a doctor, and their mother. It is
evening and the weather is very cold outside. The little girl and boy
are writing letters&mdash;can you guess to whom they are writing?&mdash;and the
mother is knitting, and the father is reading his newspaper; as you will
see in a moment for yourselves. So be very quiet, for now it is going to
begin.
</p>

<div style="height: 4em;"><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

<h2>
    Up The Chimney
</h2>
<h3>
The First Scene
</h3>
<p>
<i>The curtain opens, and you see a room in a house and four people,
just as Mother Goose promised. On one side is a fire-place, and notice
the stockings hanging by it. At the back is a window, looking out into
the street, but you cannot see anything there, because it is dark out of
doors. The little girl's name is Polly, but the first one to speak is
her brother, named</i> JACK, <i>who looks up from his letter and
says</i>:
</p>
<p>
Mother, how do you spell "friend"?
</p>
<p>
MOTHER <i>answers</i>: F, r, i, e, n, d. Have you nearly finished your
letter, Jack?
</p>
<p>
Yes, <i>says</i> JACK, <i>still writing. Then he stops, straightens up
and says</i>, There! It's all done. Shall I read it to you, Mother?
</p>
<p>
Do, MOTHER <i>answers. And Father puts down his newspaper to listen, and
Polly stops writing. Mother goes on knitting, because she can knit and
listen at the same time</i>.
</p>
<p>
<i>So</i> JACK <i>reads</i>: "Dear Santa Claus, I have been very
good this year&mdash;most of the time; and I wish you would
bring me a toy soldier. I am very well and I hope you are.
Your loving little friend, Jack." Is that all right, Mother?
</p>
<p>
It is a very good letter, <i>says</i> MOTHER; only I thought you were
going to speak about that pair of warm gloves for Father.
</p>
<p>
Oh, I forget that, <i>says</i> JACK, <i>looking a little bit
ashamed</i>. I'll put it in a postscript. <i>So he goes on writing, and
so does Polly</i>. JACK <i>says his words aloud while he writes
them</i>: "P.S.&mdash;Fa&mdash;ather&mdash;would&mdash;like&mdash;a&mdash;pair&mdash;of&mdash;warm&mdash;gloves."
</p>
<p>
MOTHER <i>looks over at Polly, who seems to have finished, and says</i>:
Polly, let us hear your letter.
</p>
<p>
<i>So</i> POLLY <i>reads</i>: "Dear Santa Claus, I am so glad that
tomorrow is Christmas. We have all hung up our stockings, and I think I
would like best to have a doll in short dresses. I love you very much.
Your little friend, Polly. P.S.&mdash;I think Mother would like a ball of
white knitting cotton." I had to put that in a postscript, Mother,
because I forgot, too.
</p>
<p>
<i>And now</i> FATHER, <i>who has been listening all this time,
says</i>: Where will you put the letters?&mdash;on the mantel-piece or in the
stockings?
</p>
<p>
Oh, on the mantel-piece, <i>answers</i> JACK. We always put them on the
mantel-piece. Don't you remember that, Father?
</p>
<p>
Yes, I believe I do, now that you speak of it, <i>says</i> FATHER.
</p>
<p>
<i>Then the children put the two letters on the mantel-piece, standing
them against the clock, so that they can be easily seen. While they are
doing this, some one passes the window, walking along the street, and
there comes a knock at the door</i>.
</p>
<p>
Come in, <i>says</i> FATHER; <i>and in comes a little woman, rather old,
and rather bent, and rather lame</i>.
</p>
<p>
Why, if it isn't little Nurse Mary, <i>cries</i> FATHER, <i>and they all
rise up to greet her. She kisses both the children, and shakes hands
with Father and Mother.</i>
</p>
<p>
Here's a chair for you, Nurse Mary, <i>says</i> JACK.
</p>
<p>
Let me take your cloak and hood, Nurse Mary, <i>says</i> POLLY.
</p>
<p>
<i>When they were all seated again</i>, FATHER <i>says</i>, I am afraid
I shall have to give you a little scolding, Mary, for coming out on such
a cold night. It really don't do, you know.
</p>
<p>
Now, Doctor John, NURSE MARY <i>answers</i>, What do you expect?
Haven't I seen you every Christmas Eve since you were half the size of
Master Jack here, and didn't I knit with my own hands the first little
stocking you ever hung up for Santa Claus, and don't I remember how
frightened you were that time when we heard the reindeers on the roof,
and when the handful of walnuts came tumbling down the chimney? And do
you expect me to stay away on Christmas Eve, like some lonely old woman,
who never was nurse to any children at all, let alone two generations of
them? What are you thinking of, Doctor John?
</p>
<p>
I am thinking, <i>says</i> FATHER <i>smiling</i>, that if you hadn't
come, we should have missed you dreadfully. But tell me, Nurse Mary, how
are you feeling?
</p>
<p>
Well, <i>answers</i> NURSE MARY, to speak the truth, Doctor John, I
think you must give me some medicine.
</p>
<p>
Medicine? <i>cries</i> MOTHER.
</p>
<p>
Are you sick, Nurse Mary? <i>asks</i> POLLY.
</p>
<p>
Yes, Miss Polly, sick, and very sick, too, NURSE MARY <i>answers</i>.
</p>
<p>
But how? <i>asks</i> FATHER. What's wrong? Where is the trouble?
</p>
<p>
First of all, in my back, Doctor John, <i>says</i> NURSE MARY. Today,
after sweeping and scrubbing a little, and baking a Christmas cake, I
just ironed out a few pieces, my best cap and apron, and the likes of
that, and before I had finished, I give you word my back began to ache.
Now what do you make of it? And then, my joints&mdash;stiff! Yes, Dr. John,
stiff! How am I to do my work with stiff joints, I'd like to know?
</p>
<p>
I see, <i>says</i> FATHER, <i>shaking his head.</i> This is a serious
matter. But cheer up, Nurse Mary; I believe I have the very thing that
will help you. <i>He opens his medicine case, which stands on the table,
and takes out a little bottle.</i> Here it is, <i>he says</i>, and let
me tell you how to take it; for with this medicine that is the most
important part. You must find some children to give it to you. If you
take it from grown-up people, it will do you no good at all, so you must
find a child somewhere, or two would be better, one to pour it out and
one to hold the spoon&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Oh, let me pour it out, <i>cries</i> JACK.
</p>
<p>
And let me hold the spoon, <i>cries</i> POLLY.
</p>
<p>
Why, that will do finely, <i>says</i> FATHER, <i>and hands Jack the
bottle.</i> And now I must go out, <i>he continues</i>; for old Mrs.
Cavendish is sick and has sent for me. It may be quite late, when I come
home. <i>He begins to put on his overcoat.</i>
</p>
<p>
And I, <i>says</i> MOTHER, have some Christmas bundles to tie up. If
Nurse Mary goes before I come back, will you both go quietly to bed like
good children?
</p>
<p>
Yes, Mother, <i>cry</i> POLLY <i>and</i> JACK <i>together.</i>
</p>
<p>
Well, good night, then, Mary dear, <i>says</i> MOTHER.
</p>
<p>
Good night, Nurse Mary, <i>says</i> FATHER. <i>Then Mother and Father
both go out, the one to her own room and the other to the street.</i>
</p>
<p>
Come, Nurse Mary, <i>says</i> JACK, you must take your medicine.
</p>
<p>
Do you suppose it is very bitter? <i>asks</i> NURSE MARY.
</p>
<p>
I think it is, <i>says</i> JACK, <i>looking into the bottle and smelling
it</i>. It looks bitter and it smells bitter.
</p>
<p>
But you mustn't mind that, Nurse Mary, <i>says</i> POLLY; because it
will make you well.
</p>
<p>
All right, <i>says</i> NURSE MARY. Pour it out.
</p>
<p>
<i>Then Polly holds the spoon, and Jack carefully pours the medicine
into it. Nurse Mary opens her mouth, swallows the dose, and makes a wry
face, shuddering.</i>
</p>
<p>
Was it horrid? <i>asks</i> JACK.
</p>
<p>
Horrid! <i>answers</i> NURSE MARY.
</p>
<p>
Do you feel better? <i>asks</i> POLLY.
</p>
<p>
I can't tell yet, <i>answers</i> NURSE MARY. I suppose I must wait a
little for the medicine to work.
</p>
<p>
And while we are waiting, <i>says</i> JACK, tell us about when Father
was a little boy.
</p>
<p>
<i>So Nurse Mary sits down, and takes Polly on her lap, while Jack sits
on a stool at her feet, and then</i> NURSE MARY <i>begins</i>, When Dr.
John was a very little boy&mdash;
</p>
<p>
But, Nurse Mary, JACK <i>says, interrupting</i>, he wasn't named "Dr.
John" then, was he?
</p>
<p>
No, <i>answers</i> NURSE MARY, he was just "Master John" then. Well,
when he was a very little boy, so that I could carry him upstairs to bed
without any trouble at all, he was the most beautiful boy you ever saw.
He had fat rosy cheeks, and fine big eyes, and stout little legs.
</p>
<p>
Was he big enough to walk, when you first took care of him? <i>asks</i>
POLLY.
</p>
<p>
No, indeed, <i>answers</i> NURSE MARY; and the first time he ever went
to a Christmas tree, I had to carry him. I held him up to see the
candles.
</p>
<p>
Did he like it? <i>asks</i> JACK.
</p>
<p>
I think that he was just a wee bit frightened, <i>says</i> NURSE MARY,
but I'll tell you what he did like. You know the little figures of Mary
and Joseph and the Christ Child in the manger, that you always set out
on Christmas Day, with the cows and the sheep standing all about? <i>The
children both nod</i>. Well, when your father saw that, and heard your
grandparents and all the older brothers and sisters singing "The Carol
of the Friendly Beasts"&mdash;just as you will sing it again tomorrow&mdash;he
held out his hands and danced up and down in my arms. I tell you, I
could hardly hold him.
</p>
<p>
Nurse Mary, <i>says</i> POLLY, won't you sing us "The Carol of the
Friendly Beasts" now?
</p>
<p>
In my old cracked voice? <i>says</i> NURSE MARY. Well, if you will both
help me, I'll try.
</p>
<p>
<i>So the three of them together sing</i>:
</p>
<center>
THE CAROL OF THE FRIENDLY BEASTS<a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small>1</small></a>
</center>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   Jesus our brother, strong and good, </p>
<p class="i2">   Was humbly born in a stable rude, </p>
<p class="i2">   And the friendly beasts around him stood. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   I, said the cow, all white and red, </p>
<p class="i2">   I gave him my manger for his bed, </p>
<p class="i2">   I gave him my hay to pillow his head. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   I, said the camel, yellow and black, </p>
<p class="i2">   Over the desert, upon my back, </p>
<p class="i2">   I brought him a gift in the wise man's pack. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   I, said the donkey, shaggy and brown, </p>
<p class="i2">   I carried his mother uphill and down, </p>
<p class="i2">   I carried her safely to Bethlehem town. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   I, said the sheep, with the curly horn, </p>
<p class="i2">   I gave him my wool for his blanket warm, </p>
<p class="i2">   He wore my coat on Christmas morn. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   I, said the dove, from my rafter high, </p>
<p class="i2">   Cooed him to sleep that he should not cry, </p>
<p class="i2">   We cooed him to sleep my mate and I. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   And every beast, by some good spell </p>
<p class="i2">   In the stable dark, was glad to tell </p>
<p class="i2">   Of the gift he gave Immanuel. </p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
<i>When the carol is finished</i>, NURSE MARY <i>looks at the clock, and
says</i>, My dears, it is time we were all in bed, or Santa Claus when
he comes, will find us awake, and that would never do. So I must be
going home.
</p>
<p>
But how do you feel? <i>asks</i> POLLY. Has the medicine done your back
good?
</p>
<p>
My back? <i>says</i> NURSE MARY. Why, I had forgotten all about my
back&mdash;not an ache in it.
</p>
<p>
And your joints? <i>asks</i> JACK.
</p>
<p>
I wouldn't know I had any joints, <i>answers</i> NURSE MARY. I declare,
I believe I could dance the Highland Fling. But where is my cloak?
</p>
<p>
<i>Then Polly gets the cloak and hood, and helps her put them on, and as
Nurse Mary goes out at the door</i>,
</p>
<p>
Good-night, Nurse Mary, <i>cry</i> JACK <i>and</i> POLLY.
</p>
<p>
Good-night, my dears, NURSE MARY <i>answers. And the door closes behind
her</i>.
</p>
<p>
<i>Now while the children had their backs turned, a funny thing
happened, for out of the fire-place there stepped, without making a
sound, a little man dressed all in green. Jack and Polly, when they turn
about, see him standing there.</i>
</p>
<p>
Why, who are you? <i>asks</i> JACK, <i>standing still, but very bravely
keeping in front of Polly.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>The little green man says never a word, but after waiting a moment
with his finger on his lips, he beckons to them to come forward, and
slowly, for they are a little frightened, they obey him. When they are
quite close, he looks cautiously around, and then draws a large white
letter out of his pocket, and hands it to Jack. Jack looks at it, and
shows it to Polly. Then he looks at the little green man, who nods his
head with a funny little jerk.</i>
</p>
<p>
Shall I open it? <i>asks</i> JACK. <i>And the little green man nods
again. So Jack opens it.</i>
</p>
<p>
Shall I read it? <i>asks</i> JACK. <i>And the little green man nods
again. So Jacks begins to read:</i> "My dear Children all over the
world, I, who write you this letter, am your old friend Santa Claus,
and how shall I tell you the sad news, for tonight is the night when
I ought to get into my reindeer sleigh and go about filling your precious
stockings with Christmas gifts, and I cannot do it because I am sick.
My back aches like a tooth ache, and every joint in my whole body is
so stiff that I can hardly move. Old Father Time, who pretends to be
something of a doctor, says the trouble is that I am growing old&mdash;the
idea of it! I sent him packing about his business, I can tell you. But
all the same I do feel mighty queer, and that's a fact. And the worst of
it is that this is Christmas Eve, and here I am shut up indoors in my
house at the North Pole, and every stocking in the world is hanging
empty. I cannot bear to have Christmas come and go without any word at
all from me, so I have gotten my good little friends the gnomes and
fairies and elves to help me out. They had some old fairy toys, that are
almost as good as new, and these they are going to carry about to all
the children; and although these gifts are rather different from what
you usually receive from me, I hope they will at least keep you from
forgetting poor old Santa Claus."
</p>
<p>
<i>Jack and Polly look sadly at one another, and then at the little
green man. He reaches out his hand, takes the letter, folds it up,
replaces it in the envelope, and tucks it away in his pocket. Then he
brings out two little packages, all in green paper, tied with green
string, and gives one to Polly and one to Jack. Then, quick as a flash,
he has disappeared in the fire-place.</i>
</p>
<p>
Where did he go to? <i>asks</i> POLLY, <i>after a moment of
surprise.</i>
</p>
<p>
Up the chimney, <i>says</i> JACK.
</p>
<p>
But what has he given to us? <i>says</i> POLLY, <i>looking at the little
green package in her hand.</i>
</p>
<p>
Let's open them, <i>says</i> JACK.
</p>
<p>
<i>So the two children untie the strings, and open the papers, and soon
hold up the things they have found inside. Jack has a pair of spectacles
with large round glasses and black rims. Polly has a curious little
brown cap. They look at them in perplexity.</i>
</p>
<p>
Oh, there is some writing fastened to mine, <i>says</i> POLLY.
</p>
<p>
And to mine, too, <i>adds</i> JACK.
</p>
<p>
POLLY <i>reads:</i>
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   "A fairy wishing-cap am I; </p>
<p class="i2">   So put me on, and away you fly. </p>
<p class="i2">   Wherever you wish, 'tis there you'll be, </p>
<p class="i2">   And quicker than saying three-times-three." </p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
<i>Polly puts the cap on her head. Then</i> JACK <i>reads</i>:
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   "Fairy spectacles are we; </p>
<p class="i2">   Put us on, and you shall see </p>
<p class="i2">   Things you never saw before, </p>
<p class="i2">   Easy as saying four-times-four." </p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
<i>Jack puts the spectacles on his nose, and begins to go about the room
looking at everything through them</i>.
</p>
<p>
Oh, Polly, <i>he exclaims</i>, I can see all sorts of queer things. I
can see what is in the table drawer without opening it, and I can see
the pictures in the books right through the covers. And oh, Polly, look
here. <i>He is looking into the fire-place, when he says this</i>. I can
see now how the little green man went up the chimney, for there are
steps in the side, all the way up. Look at them.
</p>
<p>
POLLY <i>looks. Then she says</i>, I don't see any steps, Jack.
</p>
<p>
It's the fairy spectacles, Polly, <i>cries</i> JACK. Isn't it wonderful?
</p>
<p>
Jack! <i>says</i> POLLY <i>suddenly</i>, do you know what we must do?
We must go to Santa Claus, and carry him the medicine that cured Nurse
Mary's back and joints. You will go first up the chimney, and I will go
after, stepping just where I see you step, and then at the top I will
take tight hold of your hand, and with my wishing cap on I will wish to
be at Santa Claus' house at the North Pole.
</p>
<p>
Splendid! Let's start this minute, <i>cries</i> JACK.
</p>
<p>
<i>Polly takes the spoon, and Jack takes the medicine bottle, and one
after the other they go up the chimney.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>A moment later</i> MOTHER <i>comes in.</i> Children, <i>she begins,
looking about; but then she continues</i>, Oh, I see: they have gone to
bed. <i>She goes across to the other door and listens. Then she
says</i>: Not a sound! They are fast asleep already.
</p>
<p>
<i>So she takes the lamp from the table, and carries it out with her,
leaving the room all in black darkness.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>And that is the end of the First Scene.</i>
</p>
<hr />

<div style="height: 4em;"><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

<h2>
    Interlude
</h2>
<p>
<i>While the curtain is closed</i>, MOTHER GOOSE <i>comes out, and this
is what she says:</i>
</p>
<p>
Children, did you see Jack and Polly go up that chimney? Well, as soon
as they got to the top, Polly took fast hold of Jack's hand and wished
to be at the North Pole, and away they went flying through the air. They
have gotten there already, I think. Hark! Yes, they are just going in
at the gate that leads up to Santa Claus's house, and soon they will be
knocking at his door. Then you will see them come in, for you will be
there before they are; and when the curtain opens, as it will in just a
moment, you will see the inside of the house where Santa Claus lives.
You must be very quiet for Santa Claus is sick, remember, and a noise
might make his head ache. Hush! It is going to begin.
</p>
<hr />

<div style="height: 4em;"><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

<h2>
    The Second Scene
</h2>
<p>
<i>When the Curtain opens, you again see a room, but quite different
from the first one. There is a door on one side, and at the back is
a sort of tall box with closed doors in the front of it, a kind of
cupboard. On shelves at the sides of the room are some toys and
packages, and a bag, nearly full, leans against the wall. There are two
people in the room. One of them, of course, is Santa Claus, but oh, how
sick he looks. The other person is a woman, you will see, and she must
be Mrs. Santa Claus. There are two other figures that look a good deal
like people, but they are only big toys that Santa Claus and his wife
have been making, a soldier on one side, and a doll on the other.</i>
</p>
<p>
SANTA CLAUS, <i>who is sitting, wrapped up in a great blanket wrapper,
and is leaning his head on his hand, while he holds a cane in the other
is saying</i>, What is the use of working any longer, for if I can't
carry the presents to the children, what is the good of finishing them?
</p>
<p>
But you might feel better at the last moment, <i>says</i> MRS. SANTA
CLAUS, <i>who is tieing a sash on the big doll that stands beside
her.</i>
</p>
<p>
That's true, <i>says</i> SANTA CLAUS. Well, I believe I'll finish this
soldier, then. He's the last one I need to make, and he's all done
except to have his cheeks painted. I'll get my paint out and finish him.
</p>
<p>
<i>So Santa Claus rises up very stiffly and painfully, and hobbles
across the room to get his paint and paintbrush. Then he sits down again
in front of the big toy soldier, and paints both its cheeks a fine
bright red. Just as he is finishing, there comes a knock at the
door.</i>
</p>
<p>
Come in, <i>says</i> MRS. SANTA CLAUS. <i>And in walk Jack and Polly,
hand in hand, wearing the fairy spectacles and the wishing cap, one
holding the bottle and the other the spoon.</i>
</p>
<p>
Donner and Blitzen! <i>exclaims</i> SANTA CLAUS, <i>laying down his
brush,</i> if it isn't Polly and Jack!
</p>
<p>
Oh, Santa, <i>cries</i> POLLY, we got your letter and the wishing-cap&mdash;
</p>
<p>
And the fairy spectacles, says JACK.
</p>
<p>
And we've brought you some of father's medicine, <i>continues</i> POLLY,
because it made Nurse Mary quite well&mdash;her back, you know.
</p>
<p>
And her joints, <i>adds</i> JACK.
</p>
<p>
And you have to take it from children, POLLY <i>goes on.</i> One of them
holds the spoon&mdash;<i>Here</i> POLLY <i>holds out the spoon.</i>
</p>
<p>
And the other pours out the medicine, <i>says</i> JACK, <i>and with that
he pours it out.</i> It's very bitter, <i>he adds, as Polly holds it out
for Santa Claus to take.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Then Santa Claus opens his mouth, and swallows the dose, with a wry
face and a shudder.</i>
</p>
<p>
Is it horrid? <i>asks</i> POLLY.
</p>
<p>
Horrid! <i>says</i> SANTA CLAUS.
</p>
<p>
But it will make you well, you know, <i>says</i> POLLY <i>encouragingly.</i>
Only you have to wait a little for the medicine to work.
</p>
<p>
And you came all the way to the North Pole, to bring me this medicine?
<i>says</i> SANTA CLAUS, <i>looking from Polly to Jack and back to Polly
again</i>. How did you get here?
</p>
<p>
First, we went up the chimney, <i>says</i> JACK, I saw the steps with
the fairy spectacles, you know.
</p>
<p>
And then, <i>says</i> POLLY, I held fast hold of his hand, and wished.
I had the wishing-cap, you see.
</p>
<p>
But weren't you afraid? <i>asks</i> SANTA CLAUS. When you climbed up the
black chimney, and when you stood on the top, in the black night under
the stars, and when you came flying through the air, weren't you
frightened?
</p>
<p>
Well, it wasn't much fun, <i>says</i> POLLY, but we didn't know how else
to get here.
</p>
<p>
And we knew you were sick, <i>says</i> JACK.
</p>
<p>
But, <i>asks</i> SANTA CLAUS, what difference did it make to you
children whether an old man like me was sick or not?
</p>
<p>
Why, Santa Claus, <i>answers</i> POLLY, we all just love you, you know.
</p>
<p>
Well, well, <i>says</i> SANTA CLAUS. <i>Then he lays down his cane on
the floor, and stretches himself, and stands up, and walks across the
room without hobbling at all.</i>
</p>
<p>
How do you feel now? <i>asks</i> JACK.
</p>
<p>
Feel? <i>answers</i> SANTA CLAUS, <i>moving more and more briskly</i>. I
feel as young as a snow flake; I feel as strong as a northeast blizzard.
Quick, Mrs. Santa Claus, bring me my fur cap and gloves. There's time
yet to fill the children's stockings.
</p>
<p>
<i>While Mrs. Santa Claus is out of the room</i>, JACK <i>says</i>:
Santa, I didn't even know there was a Mrs. Santa Claus.
</p>
<p>
Have you ever been very sick? <i>asks</i> SANTA CLAUS.
</p>
<p>
We've had chicken pox, <i>answers</i> JACK.
</p>
<p>
Oh, that doesn't count, <i>says</i> SANTA CLAUS, but some times, when
children are very sick indeed&mdash;or, for days and days&mdash;and when they are
very good and patient, and take their medicine, and never kick the bed
clothes off, then Mrs. Santa Claus comes in the night, and brings them
a present, and when they wake up, they find it beside the bed.
</p>
<p>
Oh, <i>says</i> POLLY, I think she must be almost as good as you, Santa
Claus.
</p>
<p>
And besides that, <i>says</i> SANTA CLAUS, who do you suppose dresses
all the dolls that I put into the stockings? She does, of course. Look
here at this fine one that she has just finished. To be sure, I make the
doll part myself, and this one here is a very fine one, if I do say it:
it can talk. Would you like to hear it, Polly? Just pull that string
there.
</p>
<p>
<i>Polly pulls the string and the</i> DOLL, <i>in a very squeaky voice,
says</i>, Ma-ma.
</p>
<p>
And, by the way, SANTA CLAUS <i>goes on</i>, I must put this doll and
that soldier into the shrinking-machine.
</p>
<p>
Why, what is that, Santa Claus? <i>asks</i> JACK.
</p>
<p>
The shrinking-machine? <i>says</i> SANTA CLAUS. That is it, over there.
<i>He points to the tall cupboardy thing at the back. Then he goes
on</i>. You see it's easier to make toys big, but I couldn't carry them
that way, for the sleigh wouldn't hold them, and besides they wouldn't
go into the stockings. So after they are made, I put them into the
machine, and shrink them. Open the doors, Polly, and we will shrink
these two.
</p>
<p>
<i>So Polly opens the doors, and at a signal from Santa Claus the doll
and the soldier walk in; but they move in a funny stiff way, because
they haven't any joints at their knees or elbows.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Then</i> SANTA CLAUS <i>shuts the doors</i>. Jack, <i>say he,</i> you
may turn the crank, if you want. <i>So Jack turns the crank.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>After a little</i> SANTA CLAUS <i>says</i>: Stop! <i>Then he opens
the door and out walk, in the same funny stiff way, the doll and the
soldier, only now they are about half as big as they were before. They
walk down to the front.</i> SANTA CLAUS <i>looks at them, shakes his
head, and says,</i> No, you must be much smaller than that. Go back into
the machine.
</p>
<p>
<i>So back the doll and soldier go; and Jack again turns the crank and
this time, when</i> SANTA CLAUS <i>cries,</i> Stop, <i>and the doors are
opened, the toys have grown very small indeed, as you can see, when
Santa Claus holds them up. He puts the soldier into a box, and then puts
the box and the doll into his bag.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>And now Mrs. Santa Claus comes in with the cap and gloves; and Santa
Claus puts them on. At the same time sleighbells are heard outside, and
a stamping of hoofs.</i>
</p>
<p>
We're off! <i>cries</i> SANTA CLAUS, <i>taking up his pack.</i> Come,
Polly! Come, Jack! I'll stow you away as warm as toast down under the
buffalo robe.
</p>
<p>
Good-bye, <i>cries</i> MRS. SANTA CLAUS as <i>they go out at the door.</i>
</p>
<p>
Good-bye, good-bye, <i>they</i> ALL <i>call back.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Then there is more stamping of hoofs outside, and a great jingling of
sleighbells, which grow fainter and fainter, as they drive away.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>And that is the end of the Second Scene.</i>
</p>
<hr />

<div style="height: 4em;"><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

<h2>
    Interlude
</h2>
<p>
<i>Again while the curtain is closed</i> MOTHER GOOSE <i>comes out, and
this is what she says:</i>
</p>
<p>
My dears, we must hurry back to the house where Jack and Polly live, for
Santa Claus's sleigh is going so fast through the sky, that it will be
there before us, unless we are quick about it. It is still dark night
there, and nothing has happened since we were there before, except that
Dr. John has come home from seeing sick old Mrs. Cavendish, and he has
let himself in with his key, and has felt his way in the dark to his own
door, and has gone to bed. He and Mother are both fast asleep, and they
haven't an idea but that Jack and Polly are fast asleep in their beds
too. But you and I know that they are in the reindeer sleigh with Santa
Claus. And all the time they are coming nearer and nearer. Listen for
the sleighbells, for now it is going to begin.
</p>
<hr />

<div style="height: 4em;"><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>

<h2>
    The Third Scene
</h2>
<p>
<i>When the curtain opens you can see nothing at all at first, for the
room is all dark, just as Mother left it, you remember, when she went
out and took the light with her. But after a moment you can hear
something&mdash;the sleighbells far away. Nearer and nearer they come; then
there is a stamping sound on the roof; then a sort of scrambling sound
in the place where you know the chimney is; and then Santa Claus, who by
this time is crouching down in the fire-place, turns the light of his
lantern into the room. He steps out carrying his pack, and then down the
chimney come Jack and Polly.</i>
</p>
<p>
Hush! <i>says</i> SANTA CLAUS, <i>with his finger at his lips.</i> Off
to bed with you both! And don't you dare to open your eyes until the
day-light comes. It won't be long.
</p>
<p>
<i>On tiptoes Polly and Jack go out at the door. Then Santa Claus turns
to his work. First he reads Polly's letter by the light of his lantern,
and fills Polly's stocking and Mother's; then he reads Jack's letter and
fills Jack's stocking and Father's; then he puts out the light so that
the room is all dark again. You hear him climbing up the chimney, then
there is a jingling of sleighbells on the roof, which grows fainter and
fainter, and then all is still once more.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>After a little while you notice that you can see faintly through the
window at the back, because it is beginning to be daylight. Very, very
slowly it grows brighter. Then the door, that Jack and Polly went out
by, opens, and in come the two children in their wrappers.</i>
</p>
<p>
Is it daylight now? <i>asks</i> JACK, <i>but he is looking toward the
fire-place instead of toward the window.</i>
</p>
<p>
Yes, I think it is, <i>says</i> POLLY, <i>and she is looking in the same
direction.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Then they go on tiptoe to the door of the other room, where Father
and Mother sleep; they open the door and shout:</i>
</p>
<p>
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
</p>
<p>
<i>Two rather sleepy voices, from</i> MOTHER <i>first and then from</i>
FATHER, <i>answer:</i> Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. <i>And</i>
MOTHER <i>continues,</i> All right, children; we'll be there in a
moment, as soon as we have put our wrappers on.
</p>
<p>
<i>The children go over to the fire-place, and feel the lumpy stockings;
and then in come Father and Mother in wrappers and nightcaps.</i>
</p>
<p>
Oh, <i>says</i> FATHER, old Santa Claus hasn't forgotten us, has he? And
candy canes are still in fashion, I see; I'm glad of that. Bring Mother
her stocking, Polly; and Jack, get mine for me. We'll sit down and take
our time about it.
</p>
<p>
No fair, Jack, <i>cries</i> POLLY. You're peeking into your stocking.
I've only felt of mine.
</p>
<p>
But my thing is in a box, <i>says</i> JACK, so that I can't see anything
anyway. Oh, let's begin quick.
</p>
<p>
All right, <i>says</i> FATHER, and ladies first. Mother, you lead off.
</p>
<p>
Shall I? <i>says</i> MOTHER, <i>feeling her stocking</i>. Oh, I know
what this round thing is: it's an orange. No, it isn't either: it's a
ball of knitting cotton. Just what I want, and the very kind I use. Now,
Polly, it's your turn to see what is in the top of yours.
</p>
<p>
I'm sure I know what mine is, <i>says</i> POLLY, <i>and then as she
draws it out.</i> Yes, it is: it's a doll.
</p>
<p>
Why, Polly, <i>cries</i> JACK, it's the very same doll that we&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Hush! <i>says</i> POLLY <i>quickly</i>. Yes, it's the very same kind of
a doll I asked for. See, Mother, she has a pink sash. Isn't she lovely?
</p>
<p>
Now, Jack, <i>says</i> FATHER, I think it is your turn next. What is in
that box of yours? Slate pencils, probably.
</p>
<p>
Slate pencils! <i>says</i> JACK, <i>indignantly</i>. You know I didn't
want slate pencils.
</p>
<p>
But are you sure you will get just what you want? <i>asks</i> FATHER.
</p>
<p>
Yes, indeed I am, <i>answers</i> JACK, <i>pulling out the box and
opening it</i>, and there it is&mdash;a soldier. I knew it would be that,
because I saw it when&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Hush! <i>says</i> POLLY <i>quickly</i>. Father, it is now your turn at last.
</p>
<p>
And I know all about mine, <i>says</i> FATHER. It is soft and squashy,
so of course it's a sponge. Now why do you suppose Santa Claus brought
me a sponge? for my old one is quite good enough.
</p>
<p>
But it isn't a sponge at all, <i>cries</i> JACK, <i>who has been peeking
into the little bundle</i>.
</p>
<p>
Not a sponge? <i>says</i> FATHER. But what is it, then? <i>He opens the
paper</i>. A pair of warm gloves, I declare&mdash;just what I need. Well,
Santa Claus is a great old fellow, and no mistake.
</p>
<p>
<i>Mother has been turning her head toward the window, as though she
were listening to something, and now she says:</i>
</p>
<p>
Hush! Is that singing that I hear, far away?
</p>
<p>
<i>They all listen, and sure enough from some distance can be heard the
sound of singing voices. The children, nodding their heads, show that
they hear it.</i>
</p>
<p>
What can it be? <i>says</i> MOTHER. Why, I know; it's the Christmas
Waits, of course, singing carols from house to house.
</p>
<p>
Oh, I wish they would sing in our street, <i>cries</i> POLLY, <i>and
runs to the window. Then she exclaims,</i> There they are: they are
coming around the corner.
</p>
<p>
<i>The others all go toward the window, and</i> JACK <i>says
delightedly.</i> One of them has a fiddle. Oh, I do hope they will stop
here.
</p>
<p>
<i>Then outside the window the Christmas Waits can be seen, all in warm
caps and mittens and mufflers. They stop just in front of the window,
hold up their music before them, and begin to sing the dear old carol,
called</i>:
</p>
<center>
THE CAROL OF CHRISTMAS MORNING
</center>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   God rest you merry, gentlemen, </p>
<p class="i2">   Let nothing you dismay. </p>
<p class="i2">   Remember Christ our Saviour </p>
<p class="i2">   Was born on Christmas Day. </p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
<i>When the carol is finished</i>, POLLY <i>and</i> JACK <i>and</i>
MOTHER <i>and</i> FATHER <i>wave to the Waits, and cry,</i> Merry
Christmas! Merry Christmas!
</p>
<p>
<i>And the</i> WAITS <i>wave back and cry</i>: Merry Christmas! Merry
Christmas! Merry Christmas!

<i>And this is the end of the Play.</i>

<h2>
    Characters and Costumes
</h2>
<p>
MOTHER GOOSE&mdash;The conventional costume; full skirt, peaked hat, cane,
spectacles, mits. It is effective for her to draw her lips tight over
her teeth so that her speech is that of a toothless old woman.
</p>
<p>
POLLY&mdash;A little girl, and;
JACK&mdash;a little boy&mdash;first in ordinary indoor clothes; afterwards in wrappers.
</p>
<p>
DOCTOR JOHN&mdash;Their father; indoor clothes; also overcoat and hat;
medicine case; afterwards in a dressing gown.
</p>
<p>
MOTHER&mdash;Doctor John's wife; indoor clothes; afterwards in kimono or
wrapper.
</p>
<p>
NURSE MARY&mdash;A little old woman; first dressed for outdoors, in cloak and
hood; simple dark dress underneath.
</p>
<p>
AN ELF&mdash;Acted by a very little boy, dressed all in green; he does not
speak.
</p>
<p>
SANTA CLAUS&mdash;At first in heavy wrapper, preferably white; underneath
this his conventional costume; later he puts on fur cap and gloves.
</p>
<p>
MRS. SANTA CLAUS&mdash;Indoor clothes of red and white, corresponding to the
conventional costume of Santa Claus.
</p>
<p>
DOLL&mdash;Acted by two girls, one much smaller than the other, but both
exactly alike as to dress, stockings, sash, hair ribbons, and color and
arrangement of hair.
</p>
<p>
SOLDIER&mdash;Acted by two boys, one much smaller than the other, but
corresponding as closely as possible in uniform and appearance, except
that the small one has bright red cheeks from the beginning.
</p>
<p>
CHRISTMAS WAITS&mdash;Boys in outdoor clothes; warm caps, mufflers, gloves or
mittens; one carries and plays a violin; others hold copies of the carols.

<h2>
    Scenery and Scenic Effects
</h2>
<h3>
SCENES I AND III.
</h3>
<p>
The stage should contain a table, a little at one side, opposite the
fire-place, and five chairs, one for each of the family, and the fifth
for Nurse Mary when she arrives. On the table a lighted lamp. For
safety, it may be lighted by an ever-ready electric torch. The lighting
of the stage must, of course, be otherwise provided for.
</p>
<p>
There should be two doors on opposite sides of the stage, and a
practicable window at the back, through which in the last scene a view
of houses or landscape is visible, and the Waits at the close.
</p>
<p>
As the fire-place is at the side, it is easy to arrange steps by which
the elf and the children appear to climb up and down the chimney. A box
or small step ladder, just out of sight on the side toward the front,
will serve the purpose.
</p>
<p>
The Carol of the Friendly Beasts may be sung to the following tune:
</p>

<a name="image-0002"><!--IMG--></a>
<div class="figure" style="width: 100%;">
<a href="images/music1.png"><img width="100%" src="images/music1.png"
alt="Sheet Music" /></a><br />
[<a href="midi/music.midi">Click to hear a MIDI of this tune.</a>]<br />
[<a href="images/music.png">Click to see the original sheet music.</a>]<br />
</div>

<p>
There is also another tune composed by Clarence Dickinson. A different
carol may, of course, be substituted, if desired.
</p>
<h3>
SCENE II.
</h3>
<p>
The Shrinking Machine stands at the back of the stage, and must be
accessible from behind, for the changing of the doll and the soldier.
There should be doors in front which can be opened wide. At one side
should be the crank. For this an ice cream freezer will serve, well
secured in place, only the handle showing through the cambric side wall
of the Machine. The sound is effective, even though the children in the
audience will announce its identity at once.
</p>
<p>
For painting the soldier's cheeks, cranberry juice is both brilliant and
harmless.
</p>
<p>
If gifts or candies are to be distributed, Mother Goose may enter again
immediately after the final curtain, and say something like this:
</p>
<p>
Well, my dear children, it is all over, and I hope it has pleased you.
I heard you laugh once or twice, and that makes me think that you must
have liked it. But there is one more thing to tell you, and this you
are sure to like very much indeed. You will remember that they had only
looked at the first things, in the very top of their stockings. Well,
after the curtain closed, they had time to look at what was left. And
what do you suppose Father found in the bottom of his stocking, down in
the very toe of it? A little note from Santa Claus, telling him that
if he would look into the fire-place he would find there some boxes of
candy, one for every child in this audience: And sure enough, there they
were: and if you will sit very still, the curtain will open again, and
they will be brought out and given to you. And so, my dears, as I bid
you Good-night, I wish you all (or, I hope you have had) a very Merry
Christmas and (wish you) a Happy New Year.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
